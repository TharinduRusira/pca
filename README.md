Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis for Apache Mahout. 

"Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components." ~Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)

PCA is one of the most widely used dimensionality reduction algorithm in statistic and machine learning applications. 

PCA in Mahout
=
Apache Mahout currently supports PCA via Stochastic Singular Value Decomposition(SSDV). This project will implement a dedicated PCA for Apache Mahout. 

Current implementation is concerned with a sequential PCA implementation but the ultimate objective is to extend the implementation as a Hadoop compatible PCA algorithm.
