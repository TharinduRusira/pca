Principal Component Analysis for Apache Mahout. Apache Mahout currently supports PCA via Stochastic Singular Value Decomposition(SSDV). This project will implement a dedicated PCA for Apache Mahout. 
Current implementation is concerned with a sequential PCA implementation but the ultimate objective is to extend the implementation as a Hadoop compatible PCA algorithm.
